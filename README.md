# Distributed Algorithms On Spark

This project implement some popular algorithms on spark.You can read the papers of them to see their details.

Currently it support the following algorithms and I will add some other algorithms in the future.

- Distributed KNN
- Down Sampling
- Over Sampling
- Affinity Propagation
- Distributed t-SNE
- Factorization Machines
- Multi-view Machines
- Block Structures Factorization Machines
- Timeseries models
- DBSCAN


This project support spark 2.x

Some algorithms modified from other repositories.
